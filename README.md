# jscare
Dumb js file to easily cause jumpscare on a html page

### How to

Basically you need to put this line of code below your entire body

``` <script src="jscare.js"></script> ```

And put button with onclick attribute of jscare()

``` <button onclick="jscare()">Jumpscare</button> ```

Easy! You can customize the background, sound and force fullscreen in the js file in the section marked with - signs

```
  image2 = "jumpscare_image.jpg",
  mp3 = "jumpscare_sound.mp3",
  forceFullscreen = false 
```

Im not responsible for the damage done or whatever, also it was made in like 15 minutes or so.
